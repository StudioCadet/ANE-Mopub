h1. Air Native Extension for MoPub Advertising on iOS and Android (ARM and x86)

Google Play Services 6.5 is now included with its resources in this ANE. Feel free to strip it if your app already includes Google Play Services.
Note : AIR SDK is shipped with a really old version of Android build tool dx.jar, and you need to manually update it for this ANE to work as expected.
